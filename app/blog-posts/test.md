# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blogpost using markdown. It should render at /blog/test

## What to Expect

Not much as this is a sample blog post, below you can see a code renderer

```js
// Example function to calculate fibonacci numbers
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

// Print first 5 fibonacci numbers
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(`Fibonacci number ${i}: ${fibonacci(i)}`);
}
```
